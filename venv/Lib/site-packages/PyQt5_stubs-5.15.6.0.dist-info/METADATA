# Mypy stubs for the PyQt5 framework

This repository holds the stubs of the PyQt5 framework. The stub files released
within the PyQt5 packages have been modified to allow using them for type-checking via mypy. 
Improvements over the default stubs include:

* Signals are properly typed as signals and not as methods
* QFlags derived classes correctly support all combination operations
* Many methods accepting an optional None have been annotated so
* and more...

This repository can always be improved and the authors will
appreciate any PRs or Issues that help making this stub-repository more reliable.

    $ pip install PyQt5-stubs
